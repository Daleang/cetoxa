Using cetoxa
========

To try out for yourself, once qvina02 is installed, run:

> ../cetoxa.py -f ../data/Compounds/Toxcast/pdbqt/20006.pdbqt -ncpu 2

This will produce an output file **results.csv** similar to the one in the github repository. Please keep in mind that the docking algorithm is not reproducible since it uses random numbers. That means that you will not obtain exactly the same results as the example.csv in the repository.
